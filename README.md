# REST
A collection of REST APIs I made using Django Rest Framework.
- Library: A basic library website with an API endpoint added to it
- Todo: A todo API back-end connected to a React front-end
- Blog: A blog API having users, permissions and allowing for full CRUD functionality. Viewpoints, routers and documentation have been added.
